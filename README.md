# Project Overview

This project is to show my understanding of how to use Jasmine framework to perform unit test on javascript code.

## Keypoins of the Project
Use "describe" to initialize a test for a specific component
Use "it" to create specs
Fill "expect" with proper matcher functions so that the spec should only be met when test is passed.
Use beforeEach and done function to perform Async test

## How to run
Simple git clone all files and open index.html
